        <p>
            Cookies are small information files that are stored by the internet browser on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or when you use a (mobile) application. They work as a kind of memory aid for a website. Thanks to cookies, our website can easily track specific information about our visitors and their browsing habits. By the term "cookies" we also mean technologies that are similar to cookies, such as pixels, plug-ins and certain scripts, as these can also collect data from you.
            <br><br>
            Cookies can be set both by Grodeba BV itself ("first-party cookies") and by third parties ("third-party cookies"). Third-party cookies ensure that certain information resulting from your visit to or use of our website will be sent to the third party that has placed the cookies.
            <br><br>
            Cookies are sometimes placed temporarily ("session cookies", these are deleted when you close the browser) and sometimes permanently ("persistent" cookies, these remain until they expire or until you delete them).
        </p>

        <h2>
            3. Which cookies require my consent, and how can I give it?

            <br><br>
            Before we place any other cookies on your device, we will ask for your prior consent via our cookie banner. You can always, fully or partially, withdraw your consent for the use of these additional cookies. How you can do this concretely, we clarify under title 5.
